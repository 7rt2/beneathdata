Title: About Me

I am a biomedical engineer and programmer by trade. I'll do just about anything on two wheels. I consider myself a good sailor, but who knows. I fell in love with Python in 2012 and haven't looked back. I get a huge kick out of hunting around for patterns in a dataset and an even bigger kick when I find one. This website tries to share some of the mini-discoveries I find and allow me an outlet to make pretty graphs.

###About this website

If you ever played SimCity, or really any of the _Maxis_ video games, __Reticulating Splines__ will sound familiar. Basically, whenever a SimCity action requred a lot of computing and showed a loading bar, the software would claim to be "reticulating splines." It became somewhat of a catch-all excuse for performing complex calculations and had the air of a difficult task, as in algebra it relates to curve-fitting. To top it off, Python, my lanuage of choice, is most often thought of as a reticulating python. 

Frankly, yes - it's a goofy name, but I needed something to go on.
