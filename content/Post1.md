Ever since _Moneyball_ was published in 2003, the idea that money is as much a part of the game as first basemen or the infield grass has become common knowledge. We all understand the basic notion that in Major League Baseball, money can define who plays on your team and therefore _how_ your team plays. What _Moneyball_ wanted to convey is that even still, money isn't everything. What the book didn't ask is "ok, money isn't everything, but how much is it?"

Various sources have tried to tackle this question in variously incompelte ways. Wikipedia takes note that "_...the New York Yankees have consistently had the highest total payroll in MLB, and they have appeared in 40 of the 109 World Series for 27 wins as of 2013 (36.7% of all World Series for a 24.8% success rate)._" [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap#Major_League_Baseball_.28luxury_tax.29) That's great, but the Yankees are one example. Somebody at Columbia Business School did a deeper investigation of the idea and concluded that 20% of success in baseball can be attributed to payroll [[2]](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014_SSAC_Why-money-is-not-baseballs-most-valuable-currency.pdf). Better. But how much is money worth in baseball, and how has it changed over the past decades? How does it affect the playoffs, if at all? Conventional wisdom seems to point in both directions - the Yankees buy great players and field great teams, but the A's and the Rays have tiny salaries and great histories of success. Who's right? 

Baseball stands apart from other North American sports in that it doesn't have a salary cap. It is this single fact that makes this debate possible. In the NFL or NBA, money can't logically have a powerful effect - each team has the same chips to play with. But baseball has never operated this way. I think it's worth a look back (real quick I promise!) to understand how we ended up here.

## The Early Days
When baseball began, teams _owned_ players. And I mean owned. [The Reserve Clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_clause) meant that players' rights were controlled by their teams. They either played for the team that controlled their rights, or they didn't play baseball at all. Free agency didn't exist - trades were the only time a player switched uniforms.

Then came the 1970's. Players banded together and formed the Players Association which allowed them to negotiate Free Agency, though even that was a long-faught battle. FA meant that now a player could enter the open market and sell his talents to the highest bidder. This opened the floodgates for spending in baseball. Suddenly, the artifically low salaries players were making in the early '70s skyrocketed( if this stuff floats your boat, go check out a great history of the economics of baseball [here](http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-economic-history-of-major-league-baseball/))
